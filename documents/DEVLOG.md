[12/9/21] Devlog Creation Test

[1] Grabbing S&P 500 tickers in a .txt file: Iteratively pinged the API. Gathered data with: /data_processing/data_scripts/stock_data_collection.ipynb

[1.5] Makefile creation

[2] Built edge and Node class with adjacency lists. Nodes store tickers and edges store spearman coefficients.

[3] Made algorithm: BFS.

[3.5] Fixed map data structure in BFS.

[4] Made algorithm: Djikstra's.

[4.5] Created test cases for BFS:

[5] Made Connected Components(CC.h, CC.cpp). Essentially DFS traversal.

[5.5] Made test cases for Djikstra's:

[12/12/21] Connected Components now works as intended.

[12/13/21] Test cases for CC.
